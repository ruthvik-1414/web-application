1. How to run the project locally using docker

build:
docker build . -t test -f dockerfile

run:
docker run -p 9000:8080 -it test

http://localhost:9000/albums

this will create a container with the image "dockerfile" and bind the container’s port 80 to the host machine’s port 9000. after the "docker run -p 9000:8080 -it docker file" command, the docker container runs on a linux virtual machine. so we can't run docker natively on windows or a mac. the following properties must be set:

set environment properties

set userprofile = c:\users\xxx  --> set your user proile 

set docker_cert_path=%userprofile%\.docker\machine\machines\default

set docker_host=tcp://192.168.0.0 --> find this ip in docker quick start terminal

set docker_machine_name=default

set docker_tls_verify=1

2.What was the major issue that you
had and how did you solve it

Error i got :

I listed down all available containers using docker ps -a.

I entered the following commands to start the container which is in the exited stage and enter into the terminal of that image.

docker start 79b3fa70b51d
docker exec -it 79b3fa70b51d /bin/sh

It is throwing the following error.

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container 79b3fa70b51d is not running

But when I start the container using docker start 79b3fa70b51d. It throws the container ID as output which is normal if it have everything work normally.

solution: By default, docker container will exit immediately if you do not have any task running on the container.

To keep the container running in the background, try to run it with --interactive (or -i) argument or --tty (or -t) or -it directly


3. How you envision multiple
environments being deployed?

Deploying multiple environments typically involves setting up separate instances or configurations of an application or system to facilitate development, testing, staging, and production. Here's a general overview of how this might be done:

Development: The development environment would be the first line of defense against bugs. Here, developers deploy their code and test any newly implemented features. Any bugs found are dealt with before re-deploying for further testing. The process is iterated until the code is ready for the next stage of testing.

Staging: Once developers are satisfied with their code and consider it fairly stable, it is then deployed to the staging environment for further testing. This is where Quality Assurance (QA) is performed. Testers access the staging servers and ensure that the application works as it should. They run test cases to detect bugs and run performance tests to find areas that could be improved. Any bugs or enhancements are reported back to the developers and the process is repeated until the code passes the staging phase.


Production: Once the code has been thoroughly tested, it is then pushed to production where it is made available to end-users.

4. How you envision the workflow of
the project

1. Approach with Attention
Before asking the first question that pops into your head, start writing them down. Prepare questions that revolve around what feedback you will take, from whom, and when.

2. Present the Feedback Request as an Opportunity
Giving feedback shouldn’t feel like a task. Try to make it sound more like an opportunity for employees to improve your and their work experience in the company.

3. Be Specific in Your Requests
Our minds go blank when we’re asked broad or vague questions without a set clue. Instead, ask coworkers about performance in specific processes, such as interviewing, presentation, or other tasks.

4. Be Open-Minded and Listen
Honest feedback might trigger you at first, but you should contain yourself and listen without interrupting. Also, calmly ask questions to clarify the reasons behind the feedback.


5. What alternative you might propose
for env variables management

The only other solution is to put all files in the same directory as the executable, so that the path is not required for accessing the files. Or define a shortcut for the executable with a default path name.

This solution is used by many applications, for exactly this reason : avoid adding themselves to the PATH.


6. How you would improve availability
in a production environment

1. Define availability requirements: Identify the cloud workloads that need high availability and their usage patterns
2. Plan your architecture: Start with a Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) to identify potential failures, their implications, and recovery strategies
3. Test end-to-end: Test the system under realistic failure conditions to ensure reliability
4. Deploy consistently: Any change can result in failure
5. Monitor application health: Monitor the health of your application
6. Limit open ports: Minimize the number of exposed entry points to your Azure environment to reduce the attack surface and enhance your network's resilience against external threats
7. Use availability sets: Create VMs within an availability set to provide high availability to your application
8. Use zone-redundant storage: Take advantage of ZRS disks to increase availability while also reducing costs 

7. If you ran out of time, how did you
envision your finished project?

If I were to envision a finished project on deploying multiple environments, it would involve a comprehensive system that seamlessly manages the entire deployment lifecycle. Here's how I would envision it:

1. Configuration Management: A robust system for defining and managing configurations across different environments. This would include configuration files for various components of the application, allowing for easy environment-specific customization.
2. Automation Pipeline: A CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process from development through production. This pipeline would integrate with version control systems to automatically trigger builds, run tests, and deploy changes to different environments based on predefined rules and triggers.
3. Environment Orchestration: An orchestration platform to manage the provisioning and scaling of infrastructure resources across different environments. This could involve tools like Kubernetes for container orchestration or infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform for managing cloud resources.
4. Monitoring and Logging: Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to track the health and performance of applications across all environments. This would include real-time monitoring of key metrics, alerting mechanisms for identifying issues, and centralized logging for troubleshooting and analysis.
5. Security and Access Control: Robust security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data across environments. This would involve implementing access controls, encryption, and other security best practices to protect sensitive information.
6. Documentation and Collaboration: Detailed documentation and collaboration tools to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members working on different aspects of the project. This would ensure that everyone has access to up-to-date information and resources needed to contribute effectively.


8. What is your recommendation for
future work?

For future work on deploying multiple environments, here are some recommendations:

1. Integration with Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Expand the project to incorporate Infrastructure as Code practices using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation. This would allow for the automated provisioning and management of infrastructure resources across different environments, further enhancing consistency and reliability.
2. Advanced Deployment Strategies: Explore and implement advanced deployment strategies such as canary deployments, blue-green deployments, or rolling updates. These strategies can help minimize downtime and risk during deployments by gradually rolling out changes and allowing for quick rollback in case of issues.
3. Environment Specific Testing: Enhance testing strategies to include environment-specific testing scenarios. This could involve simulating realistic user behavior and data conditions in each environment to uncover environment-specific issues early in the development lifecycle.
4. Optimization for Cost and Efficiency: Analyze and optimize the usage of resources across different environments to minimize costs and improve efficiency. This could involve rightsizing infrastructure resources, implementing auto-scaling policies, or leveraging serverless technologies where applicable.
5. Security Automation: Implement security automation practices to continuously monitor and enforce security policies across all environments. This could include automated vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and incident response automation to enhance the overall security posture of the system.
6. Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement: Establish a feedback loop to gather insights from users and stakeholders on the effectiveness of the deployment process. Use this feedback to continuously improve and refine the deployment pipeline, infrastructure configurations, and overall development workflow.
